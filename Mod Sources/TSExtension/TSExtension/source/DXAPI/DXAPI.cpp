/**
 *	@file DXAPI.cpp
 *	@brief The DXAPI is an API that allows you to manipulate various game objects 
 *	in Tribes 2 from raw C++ code. It dynamically resolves the addresses of member
 *	variables as you can't really trust the compiler to produce binary compatible classes,
 *	especially with all the inheritance involved in the original Tribes 2 codebase.
 *
 *	This code wouldn't be possible without Linker's original gift on the-construct.net forums,
 *	whose files are appropriately labelled in this codebase. These files have been edited where
 *	appropriate in order to make that code play better with the DXAPI.
